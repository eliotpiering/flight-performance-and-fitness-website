        <p><b>Margaret Ames</b><br>
        Flight has had a huge impact on my fitness in such a short amount of time. The small group classes have a great environment with everyone pushing each other to do their best. The trainers care about you as a client but also as a person, they take the time to get to know you and invest in your well-being. The sense of community is what encourages me to go each day and I cannot thank the flight fam enough for making me an all around stronger individual.

        <p><b>Mike</b><br>
        Mike is your normal 9-5 desk worker who struggled with posture. Mike's posture was keeping him from being able to properly perform compound movements in the gym.  Doing the propper myofascial release techniques and mobility drills we were able to not only improve his posture but also his range of motion in many movements.  Besides the postural improvement, Mike has also put 200lbs on his deadlift and over 100lbs on his squat and bench press!

        <p><b>Dan</b><br>
        Dan has lost 50 lbs in the last 2 years! I am so proud of this guy. He has completely changed his lifestyle and has developed a true love for fitness. Dan is also one of the genuinely nicest people I have ever met so it is extra special to have helped him reach his goals.  You always have the power to change your life. </p>

        <p><b>Evin</b><br>
        Here is Evin, an international rugby player that came to me with back and hip pain.  With the proper myofacsial release techniques and corrective exercise, we were able to improve his lumbar spine stabilization to make him pain free and more effective on the field!</p>
